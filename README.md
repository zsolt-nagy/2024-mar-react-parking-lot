# Browser Parking Lot 

The objective of this project is to store useful links with a todo item that can be prioritized using the labels HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.   

An item contains:  

- a link   
- a short text description  
- date of creation   
- priority label (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`)  

The Browser Parking Lot enables you to eliminate tabs in your browser. Therefore, we reduce memory consumption of your computer, because using the browser as a todo list is counterproductive.
